# Database Parameter Fix - Completed ✅

## Summary

The database parameter issue identified in `/Users/punk1290/git/blackholio-agent/UNIFIED_CLIENT_DATABASE_PARAMETER_FIX.md` has been successfully resolved.

## What Was Fixed

### Issue
The `GameClient` class in blackholio-python-client was ignoring the `database` parameter passed to `create_game_client()` and always using the environment configuration default (`blackholio_rust`), preventing connections to custom database identities required by blackholio-agent.

### Solution
Added a single line to `src/blackholio_client/client.py:68`:
```python
self._config.spacetime_db_identity = database
```

This ensures the passed database parameter properly overrides the environment default.

## Changes Made

- **File**: `src/blackholio_client/client.py`
- **Line**: 68 (added)
- **Commit**: `686c685` - "fix: ensure GameClient respects database parameter instead of using environment default"
- **Branch**: `main` (pushed to origin)

## Verification

The fix was tested and verified to work correctly:

1. **Custom Database Test**: Confirmed that custom database identities (like `c2008b29febcbc2fb0545cbc93aa38e0fac4b6e0637928c2344b3d424cb4eb03`) are properly used in the connection URL
2. **Default Database Test**: Confirmed that default database names (like `blackholio_rust`) continue to work as expected
3. **Connection URL**: Verified that `client._config.get_connection_url()` now contains the correct database identity

## Impact for blackholio-agent

The blackholio-agent can now:
- ✅ Connect to specific database identities as required for training environments
- ✅ Use the unified client without HTTP 400 errors
- ✅ Complete the migration to the unified client infrastructure
- ✅ Access real server connections instead of simulation mode

## Next Steps for blackholio-agent

1. Pull the latest blackholio-python-client changes
2. The `BlackholioConnectionAdapter` should now work correctly with custom database identities
3. Training scripts like `scripts/train_agent.py --db-identity <custom_id>` should connect to the correct database

The fix is backward compatible and requires no changes to existing blackholio-agent code.
