# Critical Fix: Event Name Compatibility (PascalCase vs lowercase)

## Issue Discovered
The blackholio-agent was still experiencing callback registration issues even after our previous fixes. Investigation revealed that events were being fired with PascalCase names but callbacks were registered with lowercase names:

```
🚀 Triggering event 'IdentityToken' with 0 callbacks  ← PROBLEM
🚀 Triggering event 'DatabaseUpdate' with 0 callbacks  ← PROBLEM
```

## Root Cause
There are two different event naming conventions in use:
1. **Protocol events**: PascalCase (`IdentityToken`, `DatabaseUpdate`)
2. **Client events**: lowercase (`identity_token`, `database_update`)

The connection was firing events with one naming convention while callbacks were registered with another.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Dual Event Triggering (`spacetimedb_connection.py`)
Modified `_trigger_event()` to trigger callbacks for BOTH naming conventions:
- When `IdentityToken` is triggered, also trigger `identity_token`
- When `identity_token` is triggered, also trigger `IdentityToken`

### 2. Dual Callback Registration (`client.py`)
Register callbacks for BOTH naming conventions:
```python
# PascalCase versions
connection.on('IdentityToken', self._handle_identity_token)
connection.on('DatabaseUpdate', self._handle_database_update)

# lowercase versions
connection.on('identity_token', self._handle_identity_token)
connection.on('database_update', self._handle_database_update)
```

### 3. Handle Different Message Formats
Added support for typed messages where the event type is in a 'type' field:
```json
{
  "type": "IdentityToken",
  "identity": "...",
  "token": "..."
}
```

### 4. Map DatabaseUpdate to InitialSubscription
`DatabaseUpdate` with 'tables' is often the initial subscription data, so we:
- Store it as `_last_initial_subscription`
- Trigger both `DatabaseUpdate` and `InitialSubscription` events

## Test Results

Before fix:
```
🚀 Triggering event 'IdentityToken' with 0 callbacks
🚀 Triggering event 'DatabaseUpdate' with 0 callbacks
```

After fix:
```
🚀 Triggering event 'identity_token' with 1 callbacks
🚀 Triggering event 'IdentityToken' with 1 callbacks
🚀 Triggering event 'initial_subscription' with 1 callbacks
🚀 Triggering event 'InitialSubscription' with 1 callbacks
```

## Impact
This fix ensures compatibility with different versions and configurations of the SpacetimeDB protocol that may use different event naming conventions. The ML training in blackholio-agent should now work regardless of which naming convention the server uses.
