   - SpacetimeDB-specific event types

3. **Multi-Server Language Support**
   - Factory patterns for Rust, Python, C#, Go servers
   - Optimization profiles (Performance, Reliability, Balanced, Minimal)
   - Server-specific configurations and tuning

### âœ… Backward Compatibility Maintained
- Existing blackholio-client APIs continue to work unchanged
- Legacy imports and patterns preserved
- Gradual migration path available
- No breaking changes for existing code

## Technical Implementation

### New SDK-Powered Components

#### Enhanced Connection Management
```python
# Old: Custom SpacetimeDB connection
from blackholio_client.connection.spacetimedb_connection import BlackholioClient

# New: SDK-powered connection (same API, enhanced implementation)
from blackholio_client import BlackholioClient  # Now uses ModernizedSpacetimeDBConnection
```

#### Enhanced Event System
```python
# Legacy events still work
from blackholio_client.events import Event, EventType, EventPriority

# Plus new SDK events with enhanced features
from blackholio_client.events import (
    create_connection_event,
    create_table_update_event, 
    get_enhanced_event_manager
)
```

#### Factory Patterns
```python
# Multi-server language support
from spacetimedb_sdk import create_rust_client, create_python_client

# Optimized configurations
from spacetimedb_sdk.factory import OptimizationProfile
```
